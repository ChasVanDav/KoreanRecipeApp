6,Chimaek 치맥,"Chimaek, short for “chicken, maekju (beer)” is actually not a dish, but an institution. This glorious pairing features two surprisingly mundane foods: fried chicken and beer. Neither half, chicken nor beer, is particularly remarkable on its own.

10,Soy sauce crab 간장게장,"Ganjang gejang, or crab marinated in soy sauce, can be so addictive that it’s often affectionately called “rice thief,” the joke being that you keep eating more rice just so that you can have more gejang since it’s just that good. Slightly tangy, tantalizingly bitter, pungent and cold, the taste may come as a shock for first-timers. But among South Koreans, gejang has been carving out a niche for itself as more of a centerpiece than a sideshow to other seafoods.",c8euGxGY32I,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8euGxGY32I,Ganjang-gejang (Raw crabs marinated in soy sauce: 간장게장),"{'channelTitle': 'Maangchi', 'publishedAt': '2013-07-28T14:38:55Z', 'viewCount': '2653625'}"
13,Samgyetang 삼계탕,"Continuing along the masochistic strain, Koreans have a saying that goes, “fight heat with heat.” What that means is they love to eat boiling hot dishes on the hottest summer days. The most representative of these is samgyetang, a thick, glutinous soup with a whole stuffed chicken floating in its boiling depths. The cooking process tones down the ginseng’s signature bitterness and leaves an oddly appealing, aromatic flavor in its stead – a flavor that permeates an entire bird boiled down to a juicy softness.",cGkca28h0R0,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGkca28h0R0,상황삼계탕 Ginseng Chicken Soup with Rice (Samgyetang) - Korean Food,"{'channelTitle': 'FoodyTrip 푸디트립', 'publishedAt': '2021-04-13T10:45:02Z', 'viewCount': '71576'}"

19,Jjambbong 짬뽕,"This dish is the soupier, spicier counterpart to jjajangmyeon and together they form the core of Korean Chinese home delivery cuisine.

It’s made by salting and preserving fermented cabbage in a bed of red chilli pepper, garlic, ginger and scallion. Feeling adventurous? Exchange your regular red cabbage kimchi for ggakdugi (chopped radish kimchi), a popular side at gimbap restaurants.

24,Tteokguk 떡국,"Originally tteokguk was strictly eaten on the first day of the Lunar New Year to signify good luck and the gaining of another year in age. The custom makes more sense if you think in Korean: idiomatically, growing a year older is expressed as “eating another year.” But this dish of oval rice cake slices, egg, dried laver seaweed, and occasionally dumplings in a meat-based broth is now eaten all year round, regardless of age or season.",plvT0vWBK14,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plvT0vWBK14,Rice cake soup (Tteokguk: 떡국),"{'channelTitle': 'Maangchi', 'publishedAt': '2013-12-28T01:11:35Z', 'viewCount': '865687'}"

The ingredients are simple: doenjang, tofu, mushrooms, green peppers, scallions, and an anchovy or two for added flavor.

27,Chuncheon dakgalbi 춘천 닭갈비,"On the other end of the galbi spectrum is the low-budget student favorite Chuncheon dakgalbi. Chuncheon is a city in Gangwon province, which developed its own unique method of grilling marinated chicken. In this dish, chunks of chicken are marinated in a sauce of chili paste and other spices, and stir-fried in a large pan with tteok, cabbage, carrots and slices of sweet potato.

29,Agujjim 아구찜,"Agujjim, also known as agwijjim, is a seafood dish that consists of anglerfish braised on a bed of dropwort and bean sprout. It is as spicy as it looks: the entire dish is a bright reddish color, from the chili powder, chili paste, and chili peppers used in the seasoning. The white, firm flesh of the anglerfish, which is quite rightly called the “beef of the sea,” is meaty and filling.

32,Hobakjuk 호박죽,"This viscous, yellow-orange juk, or porridge, gets its distinctive color and flavor from the pumpkin, its namesake and its main ingredient. The pumpkin is peeled, boiled, and blended with glutinous rice flour, and the result is a bowl of porridge so creamy, golden, and sweet that in some ways it seems more pudding than porridge. Hobakjuk is often served as an appetizer to meals, or as a health food: it is supposedly beneficial to those suffering from intestinal problems.

36,Mudfish Soup 추어탕,"This spicy soup has a consistency closer to that of stew. Although mashed and boiled to the point where it is unrecognizable, chueotang is named for the freshwater mudfish (chueo) that constitutes the main ingredient. But the selling point of this soup is the coarse yet satisfying texture of the mudfish and the vegetables – mung bean sprouts, dried radish greens, sweet potato stems, and most of all the thin, delicate outer cabbage leaves.",cPFmxXKyU8U,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPFmxXKyU8U,추어탕 Selling 500 bowls a day!

This well-known sweet meat dish, which has existed in some form for over a thousand years, was haute cuisine during the Joseon Dynasty.

Their fearlessness is a sure sign that your car won’t be budging for a while yet. Ppeongtwiti is onomatopoeic. The ppeong represents the sound that rice makes as it pops, and there really isn’t much else to the snack but that – popping. If you’re feeling tired of all the greasy, barbecue-flavored, chocolate-covered, and over-packaged snacks that most stores stock today, try a handful of this relatively Spartan treat. It’s unexpectedly addictive.

4,Samgyeopsal 삼겹살,"Samgyeopsal is the Korean word for pork belly, and it’s a staple at what many Westerners know simply as Korean BBQ restaurants. The best part of eating in a samgyeopsal restaurant is the atmosphere – a rollicking party punctuated by soju shots, pork strips sizzling on a grill and shouts for “one more serving, please!” Served with lettuce, perilla leaves, sliced onions and raw garlic,  the meat is smudged in ssamjang (a mix of soybean paste called ‘doenjang’ and chili paste called ‘gochujang’) or salt and pepper in sesame oil.",HrUVx1xnbAs,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HrUVx1xnbAs,대왕 솥뚜껑 삼겹살! 숨은 찐 동네맛집 이라길래 가봤습니다🤔 사장님이 음식에 진심인 천호동 맛집 먹방,"{'channelTitle': 'tzuyang쯔양', 'publishedAt': '2024-05-05T12:00:18Z', 'viewCount': '1405893'}"
12,Gopchang 곱창,"Gopchang refers to the small intestines from pork or cattle, which, chopped into rounded sections, can be cooked into soups, stir-fried, or grilled. Grilled, gopchang is yet another important aspect of Korean barbecue culture. Chewy without being rubbery, it’s a bit more festive than samgyeopsal, although it’s still a staunchly earthy food.

39,Nakji bokkeum 낙지볶음,"In this enduring favorite, octopus is stir-fried with vegetables in a sauce of chili paste, chili powder, green peppers, and chili peppers – ingredients that would be spicy enough on their own, but which all congregate to create one extra fiery dish. When it’s done right, the chewy, tender octopus swims in a thick, dark red, caramelized sauce, so good that you can ignore the fact that it sets your mouth aflame to keep eating.

8,Kimchi Stew 김치찌개,"A lesser-known fact about kimchi is its versatility as an ingredient in a whole slew of derivative dishes, which comprise a category of their own.

9,Army Stew 부대찌개,"This hodgepodge stew of sausages, Spam, American cheese, instant noodles, tteok, and assorted vegetables dates back to the aftermath of the Korean War.

Then there are, of course, the variations on the bingsu, where the pat is sometimes entirely replaced by ice cream or fruit.

Most gamjatang places are open 24 hours, because South Koreans tend to crave this stew in the early hours of the morning as an alternative to hangover stew.

The soft tofu – which breaks into fluffy chunks in the stew – holds the flavor of the clam and serves as a relief from the overall spiciness.

28,Bossam 보쌈,"As is frequently the case with many South Korean meat dishes, Bossam at its core is simple: steamed pork. But key to this dish is that the steamed pork is sliced into squares slightly larger than a bite, lovingly wrapped in a leaf of lettuce, perilla, or kimchi, and daubed with a dipping sauce. There are two traditional options: ssamjang, made of chili paste and soybean paste (doenjang), or saeujeot, a painfully salty pink sauce made of tiny pickled shrimp.

34,Naengmyeon 냉면,"In South Korea we wait for summer just so we can start eating naengmyeon every week. The cold buckwheat noodles are great as a lightweight lunch option or after Korean barbecue, as a way to cleanse the palate.
